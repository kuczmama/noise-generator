## Features 🎵
- **Variety of Sounds**: Choose from classic white noise, calming pink noise, or deep brown noise.
- **Interactive Design**: NoisyNest boasts a sleek and minimalist design, allowing you to change the noise type with an Apple-esque dropdown that's both beautiful and functional.
- **Adaptive UI**: With a UI that changes color based on the noise type selected, we ensure an aesthetic that matches the ambiance.
